  "BiographyOne"	:	"I was born on a very beautiful sunny October day  in Balikesir, Turkey. I grew up there with my friends and relatives.  I moved Eskisehir, which is one of the really beautiful old cities of Turkey. I started my university life there. I studied computer engineering at Eskisehir Osmangazi University. I forged life-long friendships there with my housemates and school mates.",
  "BiographyTwo"	:	"After I graduated as a computer engineer, I decided to come to Canada to study web technologies and to experience Canadian lifestyle with beautiful Canadian people. I visited Niagara Falls which it was a magical place to be and also unexpectedly wet. I have tried poutine and butter tarts and  liked both of them. Canadian Maple syrup makes anything better which is kind of a surprise for me.",
